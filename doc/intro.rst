Intro

Okayâ€¦ why should I use this thing?

It offers:

* the next departures for any station in the mvv (duh)
* listing nearby stations based on geolocation
* routing from station to station

 * routing from anywhere to anywhere (coming soon!)

It tries to build as much glue logic around the mvg.de api to make it convinient to use without messing to much with the actual api responses.

Take a look at example.py, it shows some basic concepts, or at the rest of the docs, where every aspect is hopefully adequately documented.
